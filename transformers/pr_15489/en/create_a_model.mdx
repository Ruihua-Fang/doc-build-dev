<h1 id="create-a-model-manually">Create a model manually</h1>

In the `AutoClass` [tutorial](autoclass_tutorial), you loaded a model by allowing the `AutoClass` to automatically infer the architecture and download pretrained configuration and weights. While we generally recommend using an `AutoClass` to produce checkpoint-agnostic code, users who want more control specific model parameters can manually create a ðŸ¤— Transformers model. This could be particularly useful for anyone who is interested in studying, training or experimenting with a ðŸ¤— Transformers model. In this guide, dive deeper into creating a model without an `AutoClass`. Learn how to:

- Load and customize a model configuration.
- Create a model.
- Create a slow and fast tokenizer.
- Create a feature extractor.
- Create a processor.

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

A [configuration](main_classes/configuration) refers to a model's specific attributes. Each model configuration has different attributes, but all models have the `hidden_size`, `num_attention_heads`, `num_hidden_layers` and `vocab_size` (if it is a text model) attributes in common. These attributes specify the number of attention heads or hidden layers a model should be constructed with.

Get a closer look at [DistilBert](model_doc/distilbert) by accessing [DistilBertConfig](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/distilbert#transformers.DistilBertConfig) to inspect it's attributes:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertConfig

>>> config = DistilBertConfig()
>>> print(config)
DistilBertConfig &amp;lcub;
  "activation": "gelu",
  "attention_dropout": 0.1,
  "dim": 768,
  "dropout": 0.1,
  "hidden_dim": 3072,
  "initializer_range": 0.02,
  "max_position_embeddings": 512,
  "model_type": "distilbert",
  "n_heads": 12,
  "n_layers": 6,
  "pad_token_id": 0,
  "qa_dropout": 0.1,
  "seq_classif_dropout": 0.2,
  "sinusoidal_pos_embds": false,
  "transformers_version": "4.16.2",
  "vocab_size": 30522
}
```

This displays all the default attributes used to build a [DistilBertModel](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/distilbert#transformers.DistilBertModel). All the attributes are customizable, creating room for experimentation. For example, if you want to:

- Try a different activation function.
- Change the dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.

```py
>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig(activation="relu", attention_dropout=0.4)
>>> print(my_config)
DistilBertConfig &amp;lcub;
  "activation": "relu",
  "attention_dropout": 0.4,
  "dim": 768,
  "dropout": 0.1,
  "hidden_dim": 3072,
  "initializer_range": 0.02,
  "max_position_embeddings": 512,
  "model_type": "distilbert",
  "n_heads": 12,
  "n_layers": 6,
  "pad_token_id": 0,
  "qa_dropout": 0.1,
  "seq_classif_dropout": 0.2,
  "sinusoidal_pos_embds": false,
  "transformers_version": "4.16.2",
  "vocab_size": 30522
}
```

Once you are satisfied with your model configuration, you can save it with [save_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig.save_pretrained). This saves your configuration file as a JSON file in the specified directory:

```py
>>> my_config.save_pretrained(save_directory="./your_model_save_path")
```

To reuse the configuration file, load it with [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained):

```py
>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
```

<Tip>

You can also save your configuration file as a dictionary or even only save the difference between your custom configuration attributes and the default configuration attributes! See [here](main_classes/configuration) for more details.

</Tip>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

The next step is to create a [model](main_classes/models). The model - also loosely referred to as the architecture - defines what each layer is doing and what operations are happening. Attributes like `num_hidden_layers` from the configuration are used to define the architecture. Every model shares the base class [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel) and a few common methods such as, resizing input embeddings and pruning self-attention heads. All models are either a [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html), [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) or [`flax.linen.Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.linen.html#module) subclass. This means models are also compatible with each of their respective framework's usage.

Load your custom configuration attributes into the model:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertModel

>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
>>> model = DistilBertModel(my_config)
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertModel

>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel(my_config)
```

This creates a model with random values instead of pretrained weights. You won't be able to use this model for anything useful yet until you train it. Training is a costly and time-consuming process and it is generally better to use a pretrained model. With a pretrained model, you can get better results faster while only using a fraction of the resources required for training.

Create a pretrained model with [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained):

```py
>>> model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

When you load pretrained weights, the default model configuration is automatically loaded if the model is provided by ðŸ¤— Transformers. However, you can still replace - some or all of - the default model configuration attributes with your own if you'd like:

```py
>>> model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", config=my_config)
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", config=my_config)
```

<h3 id="model-heads">Model heads</h3>

At this point, you have a base DistilBert model which outputs some *hidden states*. To make sense of these values, the hidden states are passed as inputs to a model head which produces the final output. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a different model head for each task as long as your model supports the task (i.e., you can't use DistilBert for a sequence-to-sequence task like translation).

For example, [DistilBertForSequenceClassification] is a base DistilBert model with a sequence classification head. The sequence classification head is a linear layer on top of the pooled outputs.

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification

>>> model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification

>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

You can easily reuse the checkpoint for another task by switching to another model head. To handle a question answering task, you would load [DistilBertForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/distilbert#transformers.DistilBertForQuestionAnswering). The question answering head is similar to the sequence classification head, except it is a linear layer on top of the hidden states output.

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertForQuestionAnswering

>>> model = DistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering

>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

<h2 id="tokenizer">Tokenizer</h2>

The last class you need before you use a model for textual data is the [tokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer). A tokenizer prepares the model input by converting raw text to tensors. There are two types of tokenizers you can use with ðŸ¤— Transformers:

- [PreTrainedTokenizer](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer): a Python implementation of a tokenizer.
- [PreTrainedTokenizerFast](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast): a tokenizer from our Rust-based [ðŸ¤— Tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/) library. This tokenizer type is significantly faster - especially during batch tokenization - due to it's Rust implementation. The fast tokenizer also offers additional methods like *offset mapping* which maps the original words or characters to their tokens.

Both tokenizers support common methods such as encoding and decoding, adding new tokens, and managing special tokens.

<Tip warning=&amp;lcub;true}>

Not every model supports a fast tokenizer. Take a look at this [table](index#supported-frameworks) to check if a model has fast tokenizer support.

</Tip>

If you trained your own tokenizer, you can create a tokenizer from your *vocabulary* file:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertTokenizerFast

>>> fast_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(vocab_file="my_vocab_file.txt")
```

As with a model, it is generally better and faster to use a pretrained model's vocabulary. Create a [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.from_pretrained):

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer

>>> slow_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

Create a [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.from_pretrained):

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertTokenizerFast

>>> fast_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

<Tip>

An [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) will try to load a fast tokenizer by default.

</Tip>

<h2 id="feature-extractor">Feature Extractor</h2>

A feature extractor processes audio or image inputs. It can inherit from a base `FeatureExtractionMixin` class, an [ImageFeatureExtractionMixin](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/feature_extractor#transformers.ImageFeatureExtractionMixin) class for processing image features, or a [SequenceFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/main_classes/feature_extractor#transformers.SequenceFeatureExtractor) class for processing audio inputs.

Depending on whether you are working on an audio or vision task, create a feature extractor associated with the model you're using. For example, create a default [ViTFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTFeatureExtractor) if you are using [ViT](model_doc/vit) for image classification:

```py
>>> from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor

>>> vit_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor()
>>> print(vit_extractor)
ViTFeatureExtractor &amp;lcub;
  "do_normalize": true,
  "do_resize": true,
  "feature_extractor_type": "ViTFeatureExtractor",
  "image_mean": [
    0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5
  ],
  "image_std": [
    0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5
  ],
  "resample": 2,
  "size": 224
}
```

<Tip>

If you aren't looking for any customization, just use the `from_pretrained` method to load a model's default feature extractor parameters.

</Tip>

Customize any of the [ViTFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTFeatureExtractor) parameters:

```py
>>> from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor

>>> my_vit_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor(resample="PIL.Image.BOX", do_normalize=False, image_mean=[0.3, 0.3, 0.3])
>>> print(my_vit_extractor)
ViTFeatureExtractor &amp;lcub;
  "do_normalize": false,
  "do_resize": true,
  "feature_extractor_type": "ViTFeatureExtractor",
  "image_mean": [
    0.3,
    0.3,
    0.3
  ],
  "image_std": [
    0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5
  ],
  "resample": "PIL.Image.BOX",
  "size": 224
}
```

For processing audio inputs, you can create a [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor):

```py
>>> from transformers import Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor

>>> w2v2_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor()
>>> print(w2v2_extractor)
Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor &amp;lcub;
  "do_normalize": true,
  "feature_extractor_type": "Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor",
  "feature_size": 1,
  "padding_side": "right",
  "padding_value": 0.0,
  "return_attention_mask": false,
  "sampling_rate": 16000
}
```

Just like the parameters in [ViTFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTFeatureExtractor), the parameters in [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor) are also customizable.

<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>

For models that support multimodal tasks, ðŸ¤— Transformers offers a processor class that conveniently wraps a feature extractor and tokenize into a single object. For example, let's use the [Wav2Vec2Processor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2Processor) for an automatic speech recognition task (ASR). ASR transcribes audio to text, so you will need a feature extractor and tokenizer.

Create a tokenizer to handle the text inputs:

```py
>>> from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer(vocab_file="my_vocab_file.txt")
```

Next create a feature extractor to handle the audio inputs:

```py
>>> from transformers import Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor

>>> feature_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor(padding_value=1.0, do_normalize=True)
```

Put the tokenizer and feature extractor together in [Wav2Vec2Processor](/docs/transformers/pr_15489/en/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2Processor):

```py
>>> from transformers import Wav2Vec2Processor

>>> processor = Wav2Vec2Processor(feature_extractor=feature_extractor, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

With two basic classes - configuration and model - and an additional preprocessing class (tokenizer, feature extractor, or processor), you can create any ðŸ¤— Transformers model. Each of these base classes are configurable to create a model with the attributes you want. As a result, you can easily setup a model to train from scratch or modify an existing pretrained model to fine-tune.

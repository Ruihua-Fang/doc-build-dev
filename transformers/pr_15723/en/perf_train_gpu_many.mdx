**⇨ Single Node / Multi-GPU**

* Model fits onto a single GPU:

    1. DDP - Distributed DP
    2. ZeRO - may or may not be faster depending on the situation and configuration used

* Model doesn't fit onto a single GPU:

    1. PP
    2. ZeRO
    3. TP

    With very fast intra-node connectivity of NVLINK or NVSwitch all three should be mostly on par, without these PP will be faster than TP or ZeRO. The degree of TP may also make a difference. Best to experiment to find the winner on your particular setup.

    TP is almost always used within a single node. That is TP size &amp;lt;= gpus per node.

* Largest Layer not fitting into a single GPU:

    1. If not using ZeRO - must use TP, as PP alone won't be able to fit.
    2. With ZeRO see the same entry for "Single GPU" above


**⇨ Multi-Node / Multi-GPU**

* When you have fast inter-node connectivity:

    1. ZeRO - as it requires close to no modifications to the model
    2. PP+TP+DP - less communications, but requires massive changes to the model

* when you have slow inter-node connectivity and still low on GPU memory:

    1. DP+PP+TP+ZeRO-1

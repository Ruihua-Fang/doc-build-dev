By default the PyTorch default is used.

Note: tf32 mode is internal to CUDA and can't be accessed directly via \`tensor.to(dtype=torch.tf32)\` as \`torch.tf32\` doesn't exit.

Note: you need \`torch>=1.7\` to enjoy this feature.

You can also see a variety of benchmarks on tf32 vs other precisions:
[RTX-3090](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14608#issuecomment-1004390803) and
[A100](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/15026#issuecomment-1004543189).

We've now seen how we can change the floating types to increase throughput, but we are not done, yet! There is another area where we can save GPU memory: the optimizer.

</h2>


The most common optimizer used to train transformer model is Adam or AdamW (Adam with weight decay). Adam achieves good convergence by storing the rolling average of the previous gradients which, however, adds an additional memory footprint of the order of the number of model parameters. One remedy to this is to use an alternative optimizer such as Adafactor, which works well for some models but often it has instability issues.

HF Trainer integrates a variety of optimisers that can be used out of box. To activate the desired optimizer simply pass the \`--optim\` flag to the command line.

To see which optimizers are currently supported:

We<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;ve now seen how we can change the floating types to increase throughput, but we are not done, yet! There is another area where we can save GPU memory: the optimizer.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optimizer&quot;&gt;Optimizer&lt;/h2&gt;

The most common optimizer used to train transformer model is Adam or AdamW (Adam with weight decay). Adam achieves good convergence by storing the rolling average of the previous gradients which, however, adds an additional memory footprint of the order of the number of model parameters. One remedy to this is to use an alternative optimizer such as Adafactor, which works well for some models but often it has instability issues.

HF Trainer integrates a variety of optimisers that can be used out of box. To activate the desired optimizer simply pass the \`--optim\` flag to the command line.

3. gradients
4. forward activations saved for gradient computation
5. temporary buffers
6. functionality-specific memory

Sometimes, even when applying all the above tweaks the throughput on a given GPU might still not be good enough. One easy solution is to change the type of GPU. For example switching from let's say a K80 (which you typically get on Google Colab) to a fancier GPU such as the V100 or A100. Although they are more expensive they are usually more cost effective than cheaper GPUs due to their larger memory and faster architecture.

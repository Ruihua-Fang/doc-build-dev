benchmark, we improve the previous state of the art by an average of 7.4 BLEU over 21 translation directions into

VoxPopuli, lowering error rates by 14-34% relative on average. XLS-R also sets a new state of the art on VoxLingua107
language identification. Moreover, we show that with sufficient model size, cross-lingual pretraining can outperform
English-only pretraining when translating English speech into other languages, a setting which favors monolingual

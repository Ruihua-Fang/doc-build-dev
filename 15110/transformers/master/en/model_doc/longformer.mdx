<h1 id="longformer">Longformer</h1>

**DISCLAIMER:** This model is still a work in progress, if you see something strange, file a [Github Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title).

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

The Longformer model was presented in [Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05150.pdf) by Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, Arman Cohan.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales
quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention
mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or
longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local
windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we
evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In
contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our
pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on
WikiHop and TriviaQA.*

Tips:

- Since the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn't have `token_type_ids`. You don't need to indicate which
  token belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or
  `&amp;lt;/s>`).

This model was contributed by [beltagy](https://huggingface.co/beltagy). The Authors' code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/longformer).

<h2 id="longformer-self-attention">Longformer Self Attention</h2>

Longformer self attention employs self attention on both a "local" context and a "global" context. Most tokens only
attend "locally" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\(\frac&amp;lcub;1}&amp;lcub;2} w\\) previous tokens and
\\(\frac&amp;lcub;1}&amp;lcub;2} w\\) succeding tokens with \\(w\\) being the window length as defined in
`config.attention_window`. Note that `config.attention_window` can be of type `List` to define a
different \\(w\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend "globally" to all other tokens, as it is
conventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`.

Note that "locally" and "globally" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note
that every "locally" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\(w\\), but also to all "globally"
attending tokens so that global attention is *symmetric*.

The user can define which tokens attend "locally" and which tokens attend "globally" by setting the tensor
`global_attention_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for
`global_attention_mask`:

- 0: the token attends "locally",
- 1: the token attends "globally".

For more information please also refer to [forward()](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerModel.forward) method.

Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually
represents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times n_s)\\) to
\\(\mathcal&amp;lcub;O}(n_s \times w)\\), with \\(n_s\\) being the sequence length and \\(w\\) being the average window
size. It is assumed that the number of "globally" attending tokens is insignificant as compared to the number of
"locally" attending tokens.

For more information, please refer to the official [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05150.pdf).


<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

[LongformerForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerForMaskedLM) is trained the exact same way [RobertaForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaForMaskedLM) is
trained and should be used as follows:

```python
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("This is a sentence from [MASK] training data", return_tensors="pt")
mlm_labels = tokenizer.encode("This is a sentence from the training data", return_tensors="pt")

loss = model(input_ids, labels=input_ids, masked_lm_labels=mlm_labels)[0]
```

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [LongformerModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerModel) or a [TFLongformerModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.TFLongformerModel). It
is used to instantiate a Longformer model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [LongformerModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerModel). It is used to instantiate an
Longformer model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RoBERTa
[roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) architecture with a sequence length 4,096.

The [LongformerConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerConfig) class directly inherits [RobertaConfig](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaConfig). It reuses the same defaults. Please check the
parent class for more information.



Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import LongformerConfig, LongformerModel

>>> # Initializing a Longformer configuration
>>> configuration = LongformerConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the configuration
>>> model = LongformerModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config

The bare Longformer Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.



This class copied code from [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel) and overwrote standard self-attention with longformer self-attention
to provide the ability to process long sequences following the self-attention approach described in [Longformer:
the Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) by Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, and Arman Cohan.
Longformer self-attention combines a local (sliding window) and global attention to extend to long documents
without the O(n^2) increase in memory and compute.

The self-attention module `LongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and global
attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and dilated
attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks. Future
release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a custom CUDA
kernel to be memory and compute efficient.

Longformer Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the
pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
  remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
  token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
  (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
  If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
  index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global

The [LongformerForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example of single-label classification:

```python
>>> from transformers import LongformerTokenizer, LongformerForSequenceClassification
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = LongformerTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096")
>>> model = LongformerForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> labels = torch.tensor([1]).unsqueeze(0)  # Batch size 1
>>> outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> logits = outputs.logits
```

Example of multi-label classification:

```python
>>> from transformers import LongformerTokenizer, LongformerForSequenceClassification
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = LongformerTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096")
>>> model = LongformerForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096", problem_type="multi_label_classification")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> labels = torch.tensor([[1, 1]], dtype=torch.float)  # need dtype=float for BCEWithLogitsLoss
>>> outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)

Longformer Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD /
TriviaQA (a linear layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).


This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

The bare Longformer Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it
as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all the
tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the
first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
`model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
`model(&amp;lcub;"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

</Tip>



This class copies code from [TFRobertaModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.TFRobertaModel) and overwrites standard self-attention with longformer
self-attention to provide the ability to process long sequences following the self-attention approach described in
[Longformer: the Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) by Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, and
Arman Cohan. Longformer self-attention combines a local (sliding window) and global attention to extend to long
documents without the O(n^2) increase in memory and compute.

The self-attention module `TFLongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and global
attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and dilated
attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks. Future
release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a custom CUDA
kernel to be memory and compute efficient.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **head_mask** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(encoder_layers, encoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*) --

  Mask to decide the attention given on each token, local attention or global attention. Tokens with global
  attention attends to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them. This is important for
  task-specific finetuning because it makes the model more flexible at representing the task. For example,
  for classification, the &amp;lt;s> token should be given global attention. For QA, all question tokens should also
  have global attention. Please refer to the [Longformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) for more
  details. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the
  config will be used instead.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the config will be
  used instead.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/output#transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple. This argument can be used
  in eager mode, in graph mode the value will always be set to True.

  attention_window + 1)`, where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

  Local attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token in the sequence to every token with
  global attention (first `x` values) and to every token in the attention window (remaining `attention_window
  + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
  remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
  token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
  (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
  If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
  index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
  attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be
  accessed from `global_attentions`.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Longformer Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD /
TriviaQA (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).


This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it
as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all the
tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the
first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
`model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
`model(&amp;lcub;"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`

Longformer Model with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output) e.g.
for Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.


This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/master/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it
as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and
behavior.

<Tip>

TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

- having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
- having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

This second option is useful when using `tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all the
tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the
first positional argument :

- a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
- a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
`model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
- a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
`model(&amp;lcub;"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

  index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
  attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be
  accessed from `global_attentions`.
- **global_attentions** (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, x)`, where `x`
  is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

  Global attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token with global attention to every token
  in the sequence.</retdesc></docstring>
The [TFLongformerForMultipleChoice](/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.TFLongformerForMultipleChoice) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

<Tip>

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

</Tip>







Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import LongformerTokenizer, TFLongformerForMultipleChoice
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> tokenizer = LongformerTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096")
>>> model = TFLongformerForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-base-4096")

>>> prompt = "In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced."
>>> choice0 = "It is eaten with a fork and a knife."
>>> choice1 = "It is eaten while held in the hand."

>>> encoding = tokenizer([prompt, prompt], [choice0, choice1], return_tensors="tf", padding=True)
>>> inputs = &amp;lcub;k: tf.expand_dims(v, 0) for k, v in encoding.items()}
>>> outputs = model(inputs)  # batch size is 1

>>> # the linear classifier still needs to be trained
>>> logits = outputs.logits
```

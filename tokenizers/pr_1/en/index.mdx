# Tokenizers

Fast State-of-the-art tokenizers, optimized for both research and
production

[ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) provides an
implementation of today's most used tokenizers, with a focus on
performance and versatility. These tokenizers are also used in [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

# Main features:

- Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today's most used tokenizers.
- Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server's CPU.
- Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
- Designed for both research and production.
- Full alignment tracking. Even with destructive normalization, it's always possible to get the part of the original sentence that corresponds to any token.
- Does all the pre-processing: Truncation, Padding, add the special tokens your model needs.
